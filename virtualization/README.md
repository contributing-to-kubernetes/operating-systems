# Virtualization

We want to run multiple "computers" in one physical machine to improve usage.
This has to be done securily and with some level of gurantee of resources.

There are a couple techniques to achieve this

* Full virtualization using binary translation
* Paravirtualization (or OS-assisted virtualization)
* Hardware assisted virtualization

> In hardware virtualization, the **host machine** is the machine that is used
> by the virtualization and the **guest machine** is the virtual machine.

> The software or firmware that creates a virtual machine on the host hardware
> is called a **hypervisor** or virtual machine monitor.
